# Safaricom AI & Innovation Strategy Protocol

## 1. M-PESA & Fintech AI Use Cases
- **Fraud Detection:** Implement real-time anomaly detection for M-PESA transactions using GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) or Neural Networks.
- **Credit Scoring:** Utilize alternative data (airtime top-ups, data usage, social ties) for Fuliza and M-Shwari credit limit assessments.
- **Personalization:** Deploy Next Best Action (NBA) models to offer tailored micro-insurance or savings products to subscribers.



## 2. Network & Operational AI
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Monitor Cell Global Identity (CGI) logs to predict hardware failures before they impact signal quality.

- **Network Optimization:** Use AI for automated spectrum allocation and traffic load balancing during peak hours in high-density areas like Nairobi or Addis Ababa.

## 3. Ethiopia Expansion Intelligence
- **Market Entry Analytics:** Use geospatial AI and satellite imagery to identify high-potential areas for initial network tower deployment (Greenfield strategy) and other growth startegies
- **Language Models:** Optimize NLP for local Ethiopian languages (Amharic, Oromo) to improve customer support automation and IVR systems.



## 4. Technology Stack & Governance
- **Architecture:** both onpremise and cloud- hybrid approach with Iguazio as ML ops platform
- **Ethics & Privacy:** Strictly adhere to the Kenya Data Protection Act and Ethiopian Communications Authority regulations regarding customer data residency and PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
- **ROI Framework:** Evaluate AI projects based on OpEx reduction (automation) vs. Revenue growth (up-selling/retention).

## 5. Implementation Guidelines
- When proposing an AI solution, always include:
  1. Data sources (M-PESA logs, CDRs, CRM data).
  2. Model type - supervised, unsupervised, semi supervised, LLMs, reinforcement learning
  3. Expected business impact (e.g., "5% reduction in churn").
  4. Regulatory compliance check.
  5. Data protection check
  6. Fairness of models and explainability check

### AI Pillars
- **Productivity**: For internal and external productivity including AML and fraud detection as well as intelligent automation and genAI
- **Monitization**: CVM and other traditional telco as well as new business for B2B
- **Customer experience**: Offer superrior customer experience

### AI Framework
- Sagemaker
- Iguazio - which is enterprise MLrun for both cloud(AWS) and on premise as the primary framework for budliing and deploying
